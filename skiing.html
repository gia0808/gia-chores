  <div class="description">
    My activities outside of school really started at a young age through my family, especially my dad. He skied in tandem with me as soon as I turned four years old. Living in Colorado, cousins and family friends would visit each winter, and skiing brought us together under one roof.
    <br><br>
    I have consistently spent Christmas, New Year’s, Easter, and weekends in between on just about every major mountain within driving distance. Sharing challenging mountain experiences with second and third cousins as well as kids of my parents’ childhood friends created lifelong bonds that I will always lean on. They live all over the map and I love to hear their perspective on things that I’m going through too.
