  <div class="description">
    Right now, I am most invested in tennis, which I started playing when I was three years old. This summer, I will play in the Cherry Creek High School girls tennis summer program and start playing ladder matches so I can make varsity next spring. My schedule will also permit me to spend my fifth summer playing Junior Team Tennis and compete in matches in the Denver area. This will all help improve my UTR and USTA rankings.
    <br><br>
    For the last two years, I have competed in regional tournaments, winning at Rolling Hills in Golden and Crestmoor Tennis Club, and being a finalist at the Rocky Mountain Tennis Center in Boulder and Denver Tennis Park. I have been privileged to learn from coaches I can emulate like Sam Martinelli who was the first All American Player on the women‚Äôs tennis team at Yale. Tennis is certainly a shared interest and has motivated me to learn more about the different paths a tennis player like me can take.
