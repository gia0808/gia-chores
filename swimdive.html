  <div class="description">
    At Cherry Creek High School next year, I also plan to join the girls Swim & Dive team. Ever since I can remember, I have loved swimming, especially in the ocean. I taught myself how to swim when I was three years old after coming close to drowning and eventually started taking lessons in diving.
    <br><br>
    In the summer after third grade, I joined the JCC Swim Team and Coach Paul was happy to work with me before and after practice. In my first year, I earned second place six times in six separate swim meets, and eventually started winning first place in individual races. I enjoy the team experience of relay races and look forward to making friends through Swim & Dive at Creek.
