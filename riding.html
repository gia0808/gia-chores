  <div class="description">
    It was Tess Marcil who introduced me to the Cottonwood Riding Club. I began English riding several years ago, and during a time of social distancing in 2021, it was especially therapeutic to spend time with horses of diverse personalities.
    <br><br>
    I made the difficult decision to walk away from that activity after my second major double forward flip over a horse's head‚ÄîGuinness‚Äîas he stopped short before a jump. I was unable to move or speak for a few minutes after the fall, and the experience made me keenly aware of my body‚Äôs fragility.
    <br><br>
    However, I will always have a special place in my heart for riding, as it taught me that earning respect from any sentient being is mutual‚Äînot one-sided or based on dominance.
